This project is a starter setup for a Loopback-based API and a React-based client app

###Goals

* Provide a starting point for new apps that cuts down initial setup time
* Build something that can be immediately deployed in Development, staging and production environments
* Document setup & customization steps for myself to use in the future
* Build only the features that I'm likely to need every time I use this regardless of the type of app

###Additional Considerations

* Prepare for particular uses that would otherwise require a lot of setup (User registration/auth, blog with categories etc...)
* Loopback doesn't handle image/file upload, this seems like something I'll end up needing regularly
